# MASH - Mesh Admin System Heuristics

MASH is a comprehensive observability dashboard for MSPs to monitor, analyze, and report on network infrastructure data across multiple customer sites.

## Project Overview

MASH integrates multiple data sources (Syslog, SNMP Traps, NetFlow, sFlow, Windows Events, OTEL metrics/traces) with full correlation capabilities. The system supports multi-tenant monitoring across different customer sites with report building, drill-down analysis, and customizable alerts/notifications while interfacing with other MeshAdmin applications.
