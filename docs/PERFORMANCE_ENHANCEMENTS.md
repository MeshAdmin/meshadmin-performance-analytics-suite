- Records database operations and error rates
- Monitors system resources (CPU, memory)
- Provides comprehensive performance summaries
```

#### LRUCache Class
```python
- High-performance Least Recently Used cache
- Memory pressure-based eviction (auto-reduces cache size)
- Hit/miss ratio tracking
- Configurable size limits and thresholds
```

#### BatchProcessor Class
```python

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Circular Import Resolution
**Problem:** Complex dependencies between `app.py`, `models.py`, and `database.py`
**Solution:** 
- Restructured app initialization to defer database operations
- Created `create_app()` function for proper initialization order
- Moved automatic service startup to controlled initialization

### Database Migration Setup
**Problem:** Missing database tables and incomplete migration system
**Solution:**
- Initialized Flask-Migrate system (`flask db init`)
- Created all database tables with proper schema
- Established proper migration workflow

### Performance Optimizations

#### 1. Caching Strategy
```python
- Device cache: LRU with memory pressure eviction
- Cache size: 1000-5000 entries (memory-based)
- Hit ratio target: >90% for repeated device lookups
- Async timestamp updates to reduce cache blocking
```

#### 2. Batch Processing
```python
- Dynamic sizing: 10-500 flows per batch
- Target processing time: 100ms per batch
- Size adjustment factor: 10% per measurement
- Time-based flushing: 5-second maximum delay
```

#### 3. Threading and Concurrency
```python
- Worker threads: 2-8 (based on CPU cores)
- Background task management with cleanup
- Thread pool executor for heavy operations
- Async device timestamp updates
```

#### 4. Memory Management
```python
- Memory pressure monitoring (512MB threshold)
- Automatic cache reduction under pressure
- Metrics history limiting (1000 packet times, 100 batch times)
- Graceful degradation strategies
```

# Monitor memory pressure
if metrics['memory_usage_mb'] > 1024:  # 1GB threshold
    # Consider reducing cache_size or adding more memory
```
